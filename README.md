# Low_C-SNR_Particle_Detection
A Wolfram Mathematica image processing code for particle flow images with low SNR/CNR.  
Originally developed for high-FPS neutron imaging in liquid metal in presence of "phantom particles" stemming from correlated noise.

The methodology, implementation, applications and validation are showcased in the following articles:  
"Particle tracking velocimetry in liquid gallium flow about a cylindrical obstacle"  
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00348-022-03445-2  
"Particle tracking velocimetry and trajectory curvature statistics for particle-laden liquid metal flow in the wake of a cylindrical obstacle"  
http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2206.11033

ATTENTION: the post-processing part of the code uses a package

Q: How does one use the code?  
A: Instructions soon to be posted here.  


Q: Is there an example dataset to test the code?  
A: One will be made public soon, with examples of output.


Q: Am I available to help apply the code to your problem?  
A: Yes, feel free to contact me at mihails.birjukovs@lu.lv or michael.birjukov@gmail.com
