# Low_C-SNR_Particle_Detection
A Wolfram Mathematica image processing code for particle flow images with low SNR/CNR.  
Originally developed for high-FPS neutron imaging in liquid metal in presence of "phantom particles" stemming from correlated noise.

The methodology and implementation are provided in a preprint (arXiv, currently under review):  
"Particle tracking velocimetry in liquid gallium flow about a cylindrical obstacle"

ATTENTION: the post-processing part of the code uses a package

Q: How does one use the code?  
A: Instructions soon to be posted here.  


Q: Is there an example dataset to test the code?  
A: One will be made public soon, with examples of output.
